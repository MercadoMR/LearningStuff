# Sproner
This is an example using Spring + Hibernate + Postgres to make a RESTful API. \
**UPDATE:** \
As the building of this mini project was succesful I made its own repository. \
I'll no longer update the code here. \
For the lastest version of this check [_Sproner_](https://github.com/MercadoMR/Sproner).
